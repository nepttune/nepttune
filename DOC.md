# Core rules

- Project runs in docker container. Docker and docker-compose are **only** tools required.
- HTTPS is standard. Self signed certificate is created if other isn't provided.
- Files copied into project are gitignored and should not be edited.
- Package already depends on Nette framework and some other libraries, so it's not needed to list them in `composer.json`.

# Initialization

First time setup requires manual download of `composer.json` and other necessary docker files. 

1. Create script with following content in projects directory and run it.
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/default-composer.json > composer.json

mkdir docker
cd docker
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/docker-compose.yml
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/dockerfile-apache-php

mkdir apache2
cd apache2
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/apache2/000-default.conf
cd ..

mkdir bin
cd bin
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/bin/js.sh
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/bin/scss.sh
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/bin/startup.sh
cd ..

mkdir ssl
cd ssl
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peldax/nette-init/master/copy/docker/ssl/example
```
> This script populates projects directory with docker files and `composer.json`.

2. Go to docker directory and run docker-compose.

[Docker](#docker) runs `composer`, `npm` and other tools to initiate project automatically. 

# Basic usage

Project runs in docker container. This approach brings many advantages, here are the most most notable ones.
- Docker container is identical on all machines. Identical versions of PHP and other libraries make collaboration easier.
- There is no need to install any development tools on your machine.
There are also few disadvantages of this approach, but this project is designed to minimise their impact.
- Docker is slow on Windows machines. 
  - Whoever is using Windows obviously doesn't care about speed anyway.
- Docker volumes have messy configuration of filesystem permissions.
  - Project includes script to fix filesystem permissions.

This project also includes scripts to run usefull tools right inside running docker container. Those scripts are located at project root.
- `docker-composer.sh` runs `composer update`.
- `docker-npm.sh` runs `npm update`.
- `docker-scss.sh` minimises `*.scss` files into `*.min.css`.
- `docker-js.sh` minimises `*.js` files using `uglify-es`.
- `docker-permission.sh` fixes filesystem permission for project files. 
  - Sets user ownership to you, so you could access and edit the files.
  - Sets group ownership to apache (`www-data`), so the webserver can read the files.
  - Sets 770 to directories and 660 to regular files.
  - All scripts above run this script automaticaly, there is no need to run it after running `composer` or `uglify-es`.
  - You ming need to call this script after adding new file.

# Configuration

- TODO
- Sensitive configuration, such as database connection, should be placed in app/config/local/sensitive.neon. which is gitignored.
(including configuration files). Configuration can be overriden in local config. Authorizator, router and other services can be overriden in configuration as well.
